Intro To Deep Learning Labs 


In a world that becomes evermore driven by data, just knowing how to program is becoming less and less sufficient. Industr leaders now not only need to understand the data they output but must also have a firm grasp of mathematics, specifically statistics, to prevent being fooled.
Again and again we see world leaders, CEOs, and the everyday man be made a fool of and lied to by misleading figures and emotions. Big Data has taken part in our lives and we must learn how to work with it rather than be overwhelmed by it. At least, that is the way I see it. 
One of the main minimal skills to have, is to understand how to get value out of data: the use of Machine Learning. 

In this repository, I will be uploading all of MIT's Winter Course 6.S191 Intro To Deep Learning Labs.
The 3 labs are meant to serve as an overview of the power of deep learning and are part of a fast-paced, week-intensive course. 
The labs are by no means a thorough and complete understanding of Deep Learning, just an overview of some of the useful tools.

As I complete these labs, I will be adding some comments, mainly for myself, on how I would increase the scope of the lab and go beyond an exerise, to a fully fledged project. 

Please feel free to view through as I learn the basics of Machine Learning and the start of my journey through the subject.
